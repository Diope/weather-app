# Weathrr

Getting my bearing with React Native, followed the React-Native documentation to setup my development environment to use Expo in lieu of the React-Native CLI, just to see how Expo works.

Uh this will be a simple Weather app to compare and contrast working with React-Native versus when I made apps a couple years ago with Swift 2 and 3.

Nothing really fancy, feel free to use this code for whatever.
